Automattic GitHub Embed
=======================

A collection of embeds using the GitHub API to make life simpler for the Jetpack Team.

Usage
=====

Just paste in a URL to a GitHub issue, pull request, commit, or gist, and this should do the rest!

It will internally parse it and convert it to a shortcode, that you could use, but it's far simpler to just slap in the URL and go.

Future Development
==================

I'll probably look at prettying up the output a bit more, as well as handling inline links and other shortcuts to refer to issues.

I'll also likely add in an option to the admin side, to let users specify the default account and repository for the blog that will be used if unspecified.  This will enable such usage as `#33` (to refer to issue 33) or the like.

I'm also interested in adding in hovercards, so they can be done more neatly inline, without needing to expand to a larger block.
